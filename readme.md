## Next Steps 

The Record Bin is in its infancy and there are many planned enhancements to come: 

- View the total length of your record collection and see how it compares to other members collections

- The ability to browse other users collections to research and discover new albums for your collection

- Connect with the Discogs(foremost online resource for Album information on the web) API/Database of album information 

- The ability to leave reviews on records that are visible to anyone who adds the record to their collection, or views the detailed page of the record

- See a random selection of albums on the homepage of the website to help expand your knowledge of music and reccommend new additions to your collection
